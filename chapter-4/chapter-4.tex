\begin{abstract}
Previous researches have shown that different solutions of the optical system can be found using saddle point based method for some simplified cases\cite{PascalTriplet2009}. It is important, however, to study whether the saddle point based method still perform well in practical lens design problems. To study this, we chose to start with a relative simple example.

\newpage

\noindent Previous investigations have shown that in an idealized lens design problem, where the structure of the landscape is determined by spherical aberration, all the solutions in the design landscape can be obtained via SPC \cite{PascalTriplet2009}. A detailed study of the design network of a simple wide angle pin-hole lens \cite{HouSimple16} shows that SPC is effective to escape from poor local minima and to reach to the global minimum. In a specific case, SPC is able to find all the solutions found in the design landscape with other methods. A thorough study of the design landscape of a complicated system will be quite difficult, but the above results for simple systems give us confidence in the ability of SPC to find new good solutions for complicated lens systems as well.

\section{Introduction}

Systems with limited amount of curvature variables are easier to be studied using saddle point construction. Given problem with small amount of variables, it is possible to investigate the solutions in the design landscape using different methods. Therefore, the quality of the solutions from saddle point construction can be evaluated. In practical optical design, especially difficult design tasks, complex systems are usually designed, where large number of lenses is used. For example, a patented objective, which will be shown later, consists of more than twenty lenses in order to achieve nanometer accuracy. These objectives are used in the semiconductor industry to produce integrated chips \cite{Matsuyama2006_LithoHis}. For these complicated optical systems, the number of possible solutions increased compared to the case of simpler systems. The complicated optical systems are also more sensitive to ray failures, which varying variables in the system can easily cause failures in ray tracing. Designing such a complex lens are usually starting from an existing design, which has similar specifications compared to the design goal. The lens is altered by the designer based on certain design guidelines \cite{LivshitsQA2013}\cite{Shafer1995_moreless}\cite{Cao2017_GroupDesign} or his/her own experience. Trial and error always evolves before obtaining a good solution. 

In this chapter, we apply the saddle point construction method in complicated design cases. For these complicated systems, it is difficult and not very practical to sort out all the minima connections in a design landscape. Nether is there enough confidence that we can find most of the solutions for a complicated systems with existing methods. Nevertheless, we can still apply the saddle point construction method to these systems to evaluate the performance of saddle point construction. The special case of saddle point construction has been used to assist the designing of complicated lenses \cite{Cao2017_GroupDesign}\cite{MarinescuSP2008}\cite{MarinescuSPS2008_p2} and the results demonstrate its possibility for finding new local minima for complicated system. The general version of the saddle point construction \cite{vanTurnhoutThesis2009} has never been described in the literature. Even though the method is not new, its application in complicated systems has not yet be studied. We have chosen three optical systems, from moderate complexity to extreme complexity, to give example on how the general version of saddle point construction can be applied in practical design situation. We will explain the difficulties encountered when handle complicated optical design, evaluating the performance of the saddle point construction method and give recommondations on how the method should be executed to achieve the best results.

%% We need an empty line before the quote environment to work around a bug in
%% the lettrine package, from which the drop command is derived.
\begin{quote}
\texttt{\textbackslash documentclass\{dissertation\}}
\end{quote}
which loads the dissertation template. The template is based on the \LaTeX{} \texttt{book} document class and stored in \texttt{dissertation.cls}. The document class accepts several comma-separated options. By default, hyperlinks are shown in cyan, which is convenient when reading the dissertation on a computer, but can be expensive when printing. They can be turned black with the \texttt{print} option. This will also turn the headers dark gray instead of cyan. Moreover, it will add a 3~mm bleed around the page including crop marks. This will help the printer with the thumb indices, since they run right up to the page borders. Finally, the \texttt{nativefonts} option can be used to override the automatic font selection (see below).

A dissertation is a big document, which makes it easy to miss warnings about the layout in the \LaTeX{} output. In order to locate problem areas, add the \texttt{draft} option to the \texttt{\textbackslash documentclass} line. This will display a vertical bar in the margins next to the paragraphs that require attention.

The contents of the dissertation are included between the \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{document\}} and \texttt{\textbackslash end\{document\}} commands, and split into three parts by
\begin{enumerate}
\item\texttt{\textbackslash frontmatter}, which uses Roman numerals for the page numbers and is used for the title page and the table of contents;
\item\texttt{\textbackslash mainmatter}, which uses Arabic numerals for the page numbers and is the style for the chapters;
\item\texttt{\textbackslash appendix}, which uses letters for the chapter numbers, starting with `A'.
\end{enumerate}
The title page is defined in \texttt{title.tex} in the \texttt{title} folder and included verbatim with \texttt{\textbackslash include\{title/title\}},\footnote{Note that it is not necessary to specify the file extension.} (see below). Additionally, it is possible to include a preface, containing, for example, the acknowledgements. An example can be found in \texttt{preface.tex}. The table of contents is generated automatically with the \texttt{\textbackslash tableofcontents} command. Chapters are included after \texttt{\textbackslash mainmatter} and appendices after \texttt{\textbackslash appendix}. For example, \texttt{\textbackslash include\{chapter-1/chapter-1\}} includes \texttt{chapter-1.tex}, which contains this introduction.

\section{Title Page}

\dropcap{T}{he} title pages are defined in \texttt{title/title.tex}, which you will have to modify according to your needs. Note that these pages are subject to the requirements of the \emph{promotieregelement} and cannot be changed at will. Apart from the names and dates, most of the Dutch text is dictated literally.

Since the thesis title and name of the author appear several times throughout the document (on the title page, but also in, \emph{e.g.}, the preface and cv), special commands are provided so they only have to be specified once. The title (and optional subtitle) can be specified with

\begin{quote}
\texttt{\textbackslash title[Optional subtitle]\{Title\}}
\end{quote}
The name of the author is specified with
\begin{quote}
\texttt{\textbackslash author\{First name\}\{Last name\}}
\end{quote}
Note that the first and last name are separate arguments, since they may be printed in different font shapes. The \texttt{\textbackslash title} and \texttt{\textbackslash author} commands also ensure that the title and author appear in the metadata of the final PDF.

See \texttt{title/title.tex} for detailed documentation on the comment and layout of the title pages. Logos of institutes that have contributed financially to the dissertation may be included on reverse side of the title page. A few example logos can be found in the \texttt{title/logos} folder.

\section{Chapters}

\dropcap{E}{ach} chapter has its own file. For example, the \LaTeX{} source of this chapter can be found in \texttt{chapter-1.tex}. A chapter starts with the command

\begin{quote}
\texttt{\textbackslash chapter\{Chapter title\}}
\end{quote}
This starts a new page, prints the chapter number and title and adds a link in the table of contents. If the title is very long, it may be desirable to use a shorter version in the page headers and the table of contents. This can be achieved by specifying the short title in brackets:

\begin{quote}
\texttt{\textbackslash chapter[Short title]\{Very long title with many words which could not possibly fit on one line\}}
\end{quote}
Unnumbered chapters, such as the preface, can be created with \texttt{\textbackslash chapter*\{Chapter title\}}. Such a chapter will not show up in the table of contents or in the page header. To create a table of contents entry anyway, add
\begin{quote}
    \texttt{\textbackslash addcontentsline\{toc\}\{chapter\}\{Chapter title\}}
\end{quote}
after the \texttt{\textbackslash chapter} command. To print the chapter title in the page header, add
\begin{quote}
    \texttt{\textbackslash setheader\{Chapter title\}}
\end{quote}

If (parts of) the chapter have already been published elsewhere, it is customary to add a reference. This can be done with the special unnumbered footnote command \texttt{\textbackslash blfootnote}. For example,

\begin{quote}
\texttt{\textbackslash blfootnote\{Parts of this chapter have been published in Annalen der Physik \textbackslash textbf\{324\}, 289 (1906) \textbackslash cite \{Einstein1906\}.\}}
\end{quote}
generates the footnote at the beginning of this chapter. Because this footnote is unnumbered, the \texttt{hyperref} package may throw a warning, which safely be ignored.

If multiple people have contributed significantly to this chapter, they can be lister with the \texttt{\textbackslash authors} command. This can be followed by a quotation using \texttt{\textbackslash epigraph} as shown above. Finally, it is customary for a dissertation to include an abstract for every chapter (except perhaps the introduction). This can be accomplished with the \texttt{abstract} environment. The abstract should be followed by \texttt{\textbackslash newpage} to start the chapter text on a new page.

In a dissertation, each chapter has its own list of references. These can be generated with the special command \texttt{\textbackslash references\{dissertation\}} from \texttt{dissertation.bib} at the end of the chapter. Note that this means that you need to run a command like \texttt{bibtex chapter-1/chapter-1} for each chapter. The bibliography style is specified in \texttt{dissertation.bst}, which is a modified version of \texttt{apsrev4-1.bst} (from REVTeX) designed to also display the titles of referenced articles. The template will automatically generate clickable hyperlinks if a URL or DOI (digital object identifier) is present for the reference. Although it is possible to manage the bibliography by hand, we recommend using EndNote (available from Blackboard) or JabRef (available from \url{http://jabref.sourceforge.net/}).

Chapters are subdivided into sections, subsections, subsubsections, and, optionally, paragraphs and subparagraphs. All can have a title, but only sections and subsections are numbered. As with chapters, the numbering can be turned off by using \texttt{\textbackslash section*\{\ldots\}} instead of \texttt{\textbackslash section\{\ldots\}}, and similarly for the subsection.
\section{\textbackslash section\{\ldots\}}
\subsection{\textbackslash subsection\{\ldots\}}
\subsubsection{\textbackslash subsubsection\{\ldots\}}
\paragraph{\textbackslash paragraph\{\ldots\}}

\section{Fonts and Colors}

\dropcap{T}{he} fonts used by this template depend on which version of \LaTeX{} you use. Regular \LaTeX, \emph{i.e.}, if you compile your document with with \texttt{latex}, \texttt{pslatex} or \texttt{pdflatex}, will use Utopia for text, Fourier for math and Latin Modern for sans-serif and monospaced text. However, if you want to adhere to the TU Delft house style, you will need to use \XeLaTeX, as it supports TrueType and OpenType fonts. Compiling with \texttt{xelatex} will use Bookman Old Style for titles, Tahoma for text, Courier New for monospace and Cambria for math. If you want to use \XeLaTeX, but do not want to use the TU Delft house style fonts, you can add the \texttt{nativefonts} option to the document class.

This template supports the use of drop caps, a large colored initial at the beginning of a chapter or section, via the \texttt{\textbackslash dropcap} command:

\begin{quote}
\texttt{\textbackslash dropcap\{L\}\{orem\} ipsum\ldots}
\end{quote}
The first argument is the capital that will be printed on two lines (in the title color), and the second argument is the rest of the word. Depending on the font, the latter may be printed in small caps.

The corporate colors of the TU Delft are cyan, black and white, available, respectively, via \texttt{\textbackslash color\{{\color{tudelft-cyan}tudelft-cyan}\}}, \texttt{\textbackslash color\{{\color{tudelft-black}tudelft-black}\}} (which differs slightly from the default \texttt{black}) and \texttt{\textbackslash color\{tudelft-white\}}. Apart from these three, the house style defines the basic colors
\begin{itemize}
%% Reduce the separation between the items, since this is just a list of words.
\itemsep 0pt
\parskip 0pt
\item\texttt{\color{tudelft-sea-green}tudelft-sea-green},
\item\texttt{\color{tudelft-green}tudelft-green},
\item\texttt{\color{tudelft-dark-blue}tudelft-dark-blue},
\item\texttt{\color{tudelft-purple}tudelft-purple},
\item\texttt{\color{tudelft-turquoise}tudelft-turquoise} and
\item\texttt{\color{tudelft-sky-blue}tudelft-sky-blue},
\end{itemize}
as well as the accent colors
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep 0pt
\parskip 0pt
\item\texttt{\color{tudelft-lavendel}tudelft-lavendel},
\item\texttt{\color{tudelft-orange}tudelft-orange},
\item\texttt{\color{tudelft-warm-purple}tudelft-warm-purple},
\item\texttt{\color{tudelft-fuchsia}tudelft-fuchsia},
\item\texttt{\color{tudelft-bright-green}tudelft-bright-green} and
\item\texttt{\color{tudelft-yellow}tudelft-yellow}.
\end{itemize}

method of removing an element in an optimum way, which can sometimes simplify a lens with no loss of quality.},

abstract = {Automatic computing methods are being increasingly applied to optical design, and the development of programs for this purpose forms an interesting chapter in optical history. Mathematically, the problem consists of solving sets of simultaneous nonlinear equations in a space of thirty or more variables limited by prescribed boundaries. Although these boundary conditions do not basically alter the mathematics, they greatly complicate the resulting program, and a specific example reveals how intricate such programs can become. The full impact of automatic methods has not yet been felt, but one result should be to shift the attention of the lens designer from the detailed correction of aberrations to the problem of securing a proper compromise between the system requirements and the conditions for sharp imagery so that better balanced optical instruments may result.},

Local minima and unique prescriptions have not been found in many-parameter problems. The reason for these absences is that image errors caused by a change in one parameter can be compensated by changes in the remaining parameters. False local minima have been found, and four cases are discussed.},

As an example, by successively using the method a good-quality local minimum is obtained from a poor-quality one. The method could also be applicable in other global optimization problems that satisfy the requirements discussed in this paper.},

In this paper, we show that damped least-squares algorithms, with maximized computational speed, can create sensitivity with respect to changes in initial conditions. In such cases, starting points, which are very close to each other, lead to different local minima after optimization. Computations of the fractal capacity dimension show that sets of these starting points, which lead to the same minimum (the basins of attraction for that minimum), have a fractal structure. Introducing more damping makes the optimization process stable.},

In typical optical design tasks, the presence of many local minima in the optical merit function landscape makes design non-trivial. With the method of Saddle Point Construction (SPC) which was developed recently ([F. Bociort and M. van Turnhout, Opt. Engineering 48, 063001 (2009)]) new local minima are obtained efficiently from known ones by adding and removing lenses in a systematic way. To illustrate how SPC and special properties of the lens design landscape can be used, we will present the step-by-step design of a wide-angle pinhole lens and the automatic design of a 9-lens system which, after further development with traditional techniques, is capable of good performance. We also give an example that shows how to visualize the saddle point that can be constructed at any surface of any design of an imaging system that is a local minimum.},

We show here that in the design landscape of a wide-angle pinhole lens and in closely related optimization landscapes, all good local minimums found by other methods can be obtained easily with a succession of one-dimensional searches starting from simpler systems. By replacing high-dimensional searches with a succession of one-dimensional searches, the design efficiency can be increased significantly. By combining this method with conventional design methods, the wide-angle pinhole lens can be designed starting from a single lens.},

abstract = {The multidimensional merit function space of complex optical systems contains a large number of local minima. We illustrate a method to find new local minima by constructing saddle points, with examples of deep and extreme UV objectives. The central idea of the method is that, at certain positions in a system with N surfaces that is a local minimum, a thin meniscus lens or two mirror surfaces can be introduced to construct a system with N+2 surfaces that is a saddle point. When optimization rolls down on the two sides of the saddle point, two minima are obtained. Often one of these two minima can also be reached from several other saddle points constructed in the same way. With saddle-point construction we can obtain new design shapes from existing ones in a simple, efficient, and systematic manner that is suitable for complex designs such as those for lithographic objectives.},

However, for imaging applications with high aspect ratio, free-form optics can help to provide solutions with clearly better overall imaging performance.

The most widely used characterization of surface shape is numerically deficient, however. Furthermore, with regard to tolerancing and to constraints for manufacturability, this representation is poorly suited for design purposes. Effective alternatives are therefore presented for working with rotationally symmetric surfaces that are either (i) strongly aspheric or (ii) constrained in terms of the slope in the departure from a best-fit sphere.},

\begin{comment}
% abstract = {Damped least square method is one of the popular methods for automatic lens design. Various improvements in this automatic optical design are mainly due to the optimization of the damping factor and the weight factor. Especially in the four stages of lens design, designers pay more attention to the \&\#x201C;correction\&\#x201D; stage, and recognized the importance of human experience in \&\#x201C;correction\&\#x201D;. The introduction of computer brought the feeling of indescribable about the balance aberration of computer. In fact, the function of computer has not gone beyond the range of balance aberration. In this paper, we discussed how to make the whole process of lens design completely automatic by computer, including the selection, correction and evaluation of the system. To achieve this process, the key step is how to make the computer think like a designer and select the type of lens. The success of lens design depends largely on the type selection. Designers who have a profound understanding of optical design theory and rich practical experience can select the simplest and most suitable one from a wide range of types, therefore, this method can also express a new global search method for optical design. Least squares is added to Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize glass selection in optical system. After comparing and analysing the optimized design solutions, the system performance is well achieved. This method can be conveniently implemented and expands the solution space of the optical system.}

Good starting points of specific system specifications for further optimization can be generated immediately using the obtained network in general. The feasibility of this design process is validated by designing the Wetherell-configuration freeform off-axis reflective triplet. The amount of time and human effort as well as the dependence on advanced design skills are significantly reduced. These results highlight the powerful ability of deep learning in the field of freeform imaging optical design.},

In this work, the DNN infers high-performance cemented and air-spaced doublets that are tailored to diverse desired specifications after being fed with reference designs from the literature. The framework can be extended to lens systems with more optical surfaces.},

Recent advances in nanoscale manufacturing, however, have enabled the creation of metasurfaces: ultra-thin optical components with sub-wavelength features that can locally manipulate the wavefront phase. Meanwhile, there has been renewed interest in GRadient-INdex (GRIN) lenses due to the extended degrees of design freedom they offer. When combined, these two technologies can provide unparalleled imaging system performance while realizing drastic reductions in size, weight, and power. Through paraxial theory and full ray tracing we produce a lens singlet that can achieve three-color (apochromatic) correction by employing a metasurface-augmented GRIN. This apochromatic singlet has the potential for application in high-quality optical systems.},

Such miniature wide-angle computational cameras have a broad range of applications, including eye-tracked extraocular cameras for retinal prostheses, and also wearable visual aids for the blind and those with low vision. As significant (typically barrel) distortion is commonplace in wide-field-of-view imaging systems, digital post-processing is often employed to generate rectilinear output images. Relaxation of the constraint on distortion during the optical system design process is shown to allow for improved optimization of other image-degrading aberrations. Analysis of the effects of distortion on the software-corrected final image during optical design is accomplished by using comprehensive image quality metrics such as the correlation coefficient and the spatial frequency response. Selection of a surprisingly large exact initial distortion value as a constraint allows for the design of a miniature wide-angle imaging system that yields significantly enhanced final image quality.},

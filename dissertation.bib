abstract = {This paper describes our experience with global lens optimization using algorithms that can modify an existing lens
construction in an optimal way or create an entirely new construction. The binary-search method assembles lens
elements according to the bits in a binary number, ensuring that all combinations of power are tested, while the saddlepoint
method can either add elements to a starting lens or start from scratch. The latter algorithm also naturally leads to a
method of removing an element in an optimum way, which can sometimes simplify a lens with no loss of quality.},

abstract = {Automatic computing methods are being increasingly applied to optical design, and the development of programs for this purpose forms an interesting chapter in optical history. Mathematically, the problem consists of solving sets of simultaneous nonlinear equations in a space of thirty or more variables limited by prescribed boundaries. Although these boundary conditions do not basically alter the mathematics, they greatly complicate the resulting program, and a specific example reveals how intricate such programs can become. The full impact of automatic methods has not yet been felt, but one result should be to shift the attention of the lens designer from the detailed correction of aberrations to the problem of securing a proper compromise between the system requirements and the conditions for sharp imagery so that better balanced optical instruments may result.},

On the basis of this new theoretical insight we develop a systematic and efficient saddle-point method that uses a-priori knowledge for obtaining new local minima. In contrast with earlier saddle-point methods, the present method can create both positive and negative lenses. As an example, by successively using the method a good-quality local minimum is obtained from a poor-quality one. The method could also be applicable in other global optimization problems that satisfy the requirements discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {The present research is part of an effort to develop tools that make the lens design process more systematic. In typical optical design tasks, the presence of many local minima in the optical merit function landscape makes design non-trivial. With the method of Saddle Point Construction (SPC) which was developed recently ([F. Bociort and M. van Turnhout, Opt. Engineering 48, 063001 (2009)]) new local minima are obtained efficiently from known ones by adding and removing lenses in a systematic way. To illustrate how SPC and special properties of the lens design landscape can be used, we will present the step-by-step design of a wide-angle pinhole lens and the automatic design of a 9-lens system which, after further development with traditional techniques, is capable of good performance. We also give an example that shows how to visualize the saddle point that can be constructed at any surface of any design of an imaging system that is a local minimum.},

abstract = {A special structure is present in the lens design landscape that makes it different from a general global optimization problem: many local minimums are closely related to minimums of simpler problems and can therefore be found by decomposing the search for them in simple steps. We show here that in the design landscape of a wide-angle pinhole lens and in closely related optimization landscapes, all good local minimums found by other methods can be obtained easily with a succession of one-dimensional searches starting from simpler systems. By replacing high-dimensional searches with a succession of one-dimensional searches, the design efficiency can be increased significantly. By combining this method with conventional design methods, the wide-angle pinhole lens can be designed starting from a single lens.},

A good solution in a network, obtained with a limited number of variables, has been locally optimized with all variables to meet practical requirements.},

abstract = {The multidimensional merit function space of complex optical systems contains a large number of local minima. We illustrate a method to find new local minima by constructing saddle points, with examples of deep and extreme UV objectives. The central idea of the method is that, at certain positions in a system with N surfaces that is a local minimum, a thin meniscus lens or two mirror surfaces can be introduced to construct a system with N+2 surfaces that is a saddle point. When optimization rolls down on the two sides of the saddle point, two minima are obtained. Often one of these two minima can also be reached from several other saddle points constructed in the same way. With saddle-point construction we can obtain new design shapes from existing ones in a simple, efficient, and systematic manner that is suitable for complex designs such as those for lithographic objectives.},

Such miniature wide-angle computational cameras have a broad range of applications, including eye-tracked extraocular cameras for retinal prostheses, and also wearable visual aids for the blind and those with low vision. As significant (typically barrel) distortion is commonplace in wide-field-of-view imaging systems, digital post-processing is often employed to generate rectilinear output images. Relaxation of the constraint on distortion during the optical system design process is shown to allow for improved optimization of other image-degrading aberrations. Analysis of the effects of distortion on the software-corrected final image during optical design is accomplished by using comprehensive image quality metrics such as the correlation coefficient and the spatial frequency response. Selection of a surprisingly large exact initial distortion value as a constraint allows for the design of a miniature wide-angle imaging system that yields significantly enhanced final image quality.},
